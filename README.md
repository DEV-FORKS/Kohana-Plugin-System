Kohana-Plugin-System
====================

A fork of a library I wrote for Codeigniter, largely untouched or changed, just updated to be a module that can be used in Kohana 3.3.

Kohana Plugin System allows you to create Kohana web applications that use hooks and allow your users to extend. It is an events system on one hand and a plugin library on the other. Currently plugins have config files, but in an ideal app you would probably use a database like Wordpress does.  Sample plugin "kmarkdown" in the plugins folder.

Simply add the folder to your Kohana modules directory, enable it in your bootstrap and that's it.
